# CantonFlow – Private Settlement Layer for Institutional DeFi

## 🧩 Overview
CantonFlow is a project developed as part of the **Canton Core Academy** and **Ideathon (DeFi & Capital Markets track)**.  
It serves as a private settlement layer for institutional participants in DeFi, built on the **Canton Network** and **Daml**.  
The project demonstrates atomic settlements, selective data visibility, and composability across multiple domains.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Current DeFi protocols lack privacy, scalability, and regulatory compliance.  
Financial institutions cannot participate safely without exposing sensitive trading data.  
There is a growing need for a privacy-preserving, compliant infrastructure for institutional DeFi.

- Atomic settlements between parties via Synchronizer and BFT consensus.  
- Selective data visibility ensuring institutional-level confidentiality.  
- Seamless interoperability through the JSON Ledger API.  
- Modular Daml templates for customizable trade logic across domains.
